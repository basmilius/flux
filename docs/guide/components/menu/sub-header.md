# Menu sub header

This component is used for creating subheaders within menus. It can display an optional icon before and after the label, making it easy to visually separate different sections of a menu.

The label text is prominently displayed, and the subheader plays a role in organizing menu items into more digestible and structured sections. This component helps enhance the readability and usability of complex menus by providing clear visual breaks.
