# <flux-spinner/>

A spinner is a visual indicator used to show that a process or action is in progress. Spinners are
commonly used to provide feedback to the user when a process is taking a long time, such as when loading
data or performing a complex calculation. They help to provide a sense of progress and prevent confusion,
letting the user know that the system is still working and that they should wait for the process to complete.
