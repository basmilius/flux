The container grid component is a basic layout tool for organizing content on your page into columns. It provides
a straightforward solution for breaking up content into sections, allowing you to present information in a clear
and organized manner. Unlike customizable grid systems, this component has a fixed structure and is not adjustable.
The number of columns, their width, and the distribution of content within each column are predetermined and cannot
be altered. Despite its limited customization options, the container grid component is still a useful tool for
creating basic layouts and structuring content.
